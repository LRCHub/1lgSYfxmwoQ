# Sasha Sloan – Lie

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Don't sleep on the couch again,
even though you took it
for the weekend
Kiss me like you wanna stay,
even though you're thinking
about leaving
Please just fake it,
pretend to look when I'm naked
Don't be honest,
promise me that you want this
Say you're lucky,
say you're lucky to love me
like you used to
Even if it isn't true
I want you to lie,
lie right to my face
Want you to put your hands
on my waist
Can we just dance
till the skies are white?
'Cause I really can't get
my heart broken tonight
I want to you to show me
there's a future here, even if
you've never really seen it
Tell me when you close your eyes
I'm all you see,
even if you don't dream it
Please just fake it,
pretend to look when I'm naked
Don't be honest,
promise me that you want this
Say you're lucky,
say you're lucky to love me
like you used to
Even if it isn't true
I want you to lie,
lie right to my face
Want you to put your hands
on my waist
Can we just dance
till the skies are white?
'Cause I really can't get
my heart broken tonight
I want you to
Touch me like you did
in the beginning
Baby, just give me another day
Touch me like there isn't
something missing
'Cause even if you don't stay
I want you to lie,
lie right to my face
Want you to put your hands
on my waist
Can we just dance
till the skies are white?
'Cause I really can't get
my heart broken tonight
I want you to lie,
lie right to my face
Want you to put your hands
on my waist
Can we just dance
till the skies are white?
'Cause I really can't get
my heart broken tonight
I want you to
Touch me like you did
in the beginning
Baby, just give me another day
Touch me like there isn't
something missing
'Cause even if you don't stay
I want you to lie
I want you to lie
